# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning. The goal is to identify key factors that lead to customer churn and build predictive models to help the business retain customers.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Telecom customer data
- **Features:** Customer demographics, account information, services subscribed, and monthly charges
- **Target Variable:** Churn (whether customer left within the last month)

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- **Environment:** Google Colab

---

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values in 'TotalCharges' column
- Standardized categorical values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Scaled numerical features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn distribution visualization
- Monthly charges analysis
- Tenure impact on churn
- Contract type analysis
- Payment method analysis
- Correlation heatmap

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression:** ~80% accuracy
- **Decision Tree:** ~73% accuracy
